				<p style="text-align: left;">The Accident Compensation Corporation began in 1974 and has continued helping citizens of New Zealand ever since. This is a wing of the government established to handle the various monetary compensations under various headings provided to the citizens.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Under this Free ACC treatment, dental injuries are included. This form of compensation includes payment for medical bills, treatment, help at home and work and help with your income while you recover.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In some cases of accidents, the dentures or oral prosthesis that a person is wearing comes off or is damaged. This cost is also taken care of under treatment injury by the ACC. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the case of dental injuries, these are the following points that are important to know for free ACC treatment. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Injuries to the mouth, gums and teeth that are caused by an accident, as a sporting injury or as a result of wrongful medical or dental treatment are covered. In case the damage to the teeth or dentures is due to normal wear and tear, decay and gum disease or if the treatment was carried out by a dental technician rather than a registered dentist or the damage occurred to the dentures while you were not wearing them, the costs will not be covered by ACC.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Dental Hub is one of the ACC recognised clinics and our expert dentists will help you fill out the necessary claim forms for the dental work post accident or injury. Once ACC has assessed the claim, they will write back to you to let you know whether or not your claim has been accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In most cases, our dentists will treat you and ACC will pay part of the cost. ACC generally can only pay a certain amount towards your treatment and any additional cost will be borne by you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The regulation amount that ACC contributes may be affected by the following</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The type of treatment requested for the injury and the condition of your mouth, dentures and teeth before the injury happened. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is important to discuss costs and payment arrangements with our dentists at The Dental Hub before starting treatment.</p>
