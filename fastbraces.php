						Why you need Fastbraces from experts?
					</span>
				</h2>
				<p style="text-align: left;">In regular orthodontic treatment, braces have to be worn for two years. In the first year, the crowns of teeth are brought into place and the next year, dental roots are targeted. Fastbraces uses a revolutionary, patented system whereby with the use of a triangular bracket and a special square-shaped wire the braces target both the crown and the root together from the very beginning of the treatment. This allows the entire braces treatment to last a much lesser time than it normally would. This concept has changed the field of orthodontics.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Depending on the condition of their original teeth, some patients start seeing changes within a few weeks of starting the Fastbraces treatment and generally the entire procedure does not take more than a year. It also wins because research has proven that this technology is less painful than regular braces as it reduces friction and thus results in pain reduction while placing the brackets. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">How this new innovation works is interesting and simple </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">1.	When teeth erupt crookedly, it means that the root is actually not in the correct place inside the gum.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2.	When Fastbraces triangular braces are affixed with a wire instead of square braces, the distance between the braces is almost doubled</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">3.	The flexibility of the wire increases due to this extra space, allowing the root to be straightened upright in a short span of time. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first step to being the proud owner of a beautiful smile is to meet one-on-one with one of our expert dentists at The Dental Hub to determine if you are a candidate for the Fastbraces system. The dentist will then do a thorough examination of your mouth and smile. Next, impressions and x-rays will be taken to create a customized treatment plan designed specifically for your new and improved smile.</p>
