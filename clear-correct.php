						Why Opt for Clear Correct at The Dental Hub
					</span>
				</h2>
				<p style="text-align: left;">Clear correct is a brand of invisible dental aligners. These straighten teeth just like traditional braces do but they are not made of metal but a clear plastic. Our dentists at The Dental Hub will take you through a series of Clear Correct aligners that will be moulded according to your need, over a period of time. These aligners will slowly and gradually push the teeth into the desired position and finally result in a perfect smile.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once you decide to move forward with the Clear Correct aligners, we at The Dental Hub will take photographs, X-rays and impressions of your teeth. These will be sent to the Clear Correct lab for a 3D modelled clear plastic mould to be created that has to be worn on teeth just like braces.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The treatment plan which the dentist charts will show the course of the Clear Correct braces, that will gradually align the your teeth into its desired shape. After the treatment plan, the dentist can show you a treatment set up, which is a computerised representation of how many braces will be required and when they will be moulded and fitted on till the desired shape is achieved. This gives you a lot of information as to how long your current brace will last, how your teeth will possibly look at a given time in the future, etc. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The general plan that is followed in most cases is four phases, in which the aligners are custom made and put in, each set for a three week period with some time in between for flexibility. The aligners are to be worn at all times except during eating, drinking, flossing and brushing. These are made of transparent plastic and do not impede in speech or oral movement. Treatment time and cost of aligners varies depending upon the original dental condition and how much of a difference you and the dentist want to see. </p>
