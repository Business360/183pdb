								<h3>Tooth Colour Fillings</h3>
								<p>At times we often feel discomfort and pain when food stuck between our teeth due tooth decay or cavity. Situation like this can be easily fixed by filling and restoring the teeth. The basic idea behind a filling is to take out all the decayed part of your tooth and then fill it up. And now we have materials that are strong enough and can have the same shade as your natural teeth which will help you have that perfect smile as well as get rid of that decay. Patient can eat or drink immediately after the filling is done as the material will be set and shaped before you leave the clinic.</p>

								<h3>Root Canal Treatment</h3>
								<p>Human teeth’s have canals in the center which act as connection for nerves and blood vessels. A deep decay, infection or any type of accident can cause harm to these blood vessels and cause you a lot of pain. A root canal treatment can help to treat this condition. In this scenario first we open up the canals, take out the septic blood vessels and nerves, clean up the root canal and at last fill it up with a filling material in-order to avoid any future infection. The whole treatment is done in span of 2 to 3 sittings.</p>
