						What is Philips Zoom Whitening
					</span>
				</h2>
				<p style="text-align: left;">Zoom Whitening is one of the many dental bleaching procedures available today. It takes place in the dental office. In this method, the ray of a lamp breaks down the activated gel in a hydrogen peroxide paste. This allows oxygen to enter the enamel and dentin, making the coloured and stained portions whiter while leaving the structure of the teeth intact. Treatments typically take about an hour and may result in up to eight shades lighter teeth. Subject to terms and conditions. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For clients who want lasting results with fewer side effects Zoom Whitening can be a viable option. Over the counter gels and pastes can often produce side effects like gum erosion and sensitivity. Depending on how fast the client wants results and what are the options they have open based on their dental health, our dentists at The Dental Hub will be happy to provide a consultation. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For dramatic results in an in-office procedure, Zoom Whitening is the best option. The entire procedure is completed within one hour in a dentists chamber. The dentist will first thoroughly clean the teeth of the patient to remove any plaque or edible detritus stuck in the gums or teeth. Then a hydrogen peroxide gel will be applied on the teeth. The light of an LED lamp (Philips) will be shined on the gel coated teeth. The light breaks down the crystals in the gel resulting in whitening of the teeth. The light is applied in 3 or 4 bursts of 15 minutes each to give the clients jaws some rest in between. The result is up to 7 to 8 shades whiter teeth. Subject to terms and conditions. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This procedure has no immediate side effects but is recommended only once annually. Sensitivity after the procedure is common, but it should reduce relatively quickly. It is possible for some of the peroxide gel to leak underneath the barriers and cause minor burns on the gums but even those do also heal quickly. How long the results will stay depends on the diet of the patients. It is important to bear in mind that beverage like tea, coffee, cola and red wine stain teeth more easily. </p>
