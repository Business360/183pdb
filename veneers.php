						Most People Choose Veneers from Us! Why So?

				</h2>
				<p style="text-align: left;">Veneers are wafer-thin laminates used to cover the surface of the teeth to re-create the natural look of the dentition and to replace the tooth enamel. They can be thought of as an outer shell for the teeth which will both protect the teeth and give a good appearance. Veneers are customised according to each tooth and are made to fit the contours of the teeth perfectly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Normally, the material used to make veneers has to be durable, mouldable and be coloured to match the existing set of teeth. By comparison, porcelain veneers are better at mimicking the light-reflecting properties of natural teeth and they also stain less easily. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our expert dentists at The Dental Hub generally recommend veneers in the following cases:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- When the teeth are discoloured due to prolonged exposure to staining material like certain orally administered drugs or the presence of fillings that are of a different colour than the rest of the tooth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- To correct malalignment of the teeth and to give them a uniformity of shape and colour</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- To repair teeth which are worn down by years of use </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- To repair broken or chipped teeth</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For a veneer application procedure, about three sittings with the dentist are to be expected. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the first sitting, the dentist examines the teeth to be veneer coated and discusses the procedure, veneer material with the patient. This is when all the patientâ€™s queries or concerns with regard to the procedure and post-veneer care etc are answered. X-rays and impressions of the teeth may be taken during this time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For the next sitting the dentist will first apply anaesthesia to numb the area where the veneers will be placed. Next, with the help of rotary instruments, the enamel of each tooth to be veneered is trimmed off to about 0.5 mm thickness. Moulds and impressions of the teeth are taken which will be used to create the veneers in the exact colour and shape of the existing teeth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally in the last sitting, the dentist will place the veneers on the teeth adjusting the fit to match with the existing teeth completely.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Dental veneers generally last up to 15 years if proper oral hygiene is maintained.</p>
